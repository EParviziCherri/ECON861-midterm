Dear [Boss's Name],

I have successfully trained machine learning models to predict the quality of programmers based on their review texts. Below are detailed instructions and an overview of our project structure, the trained models, and the training process.

Project Overview:
1. Folders Structure:

* Original Program Folder: Stars (1: Bad, 2: Average, 3: Good)
* New Criteria Folder: (1:Really Bad, 2: Not Really Bad)
  
Contains resources related to the training and predicting process.
Includes:
* private_files: Code for training models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Random Forest) for programmer quality prediction based on review texts.
* boss-files: Directory with prediction code using trained models to assess programmer quality with new review texts. I have saved the trained model (text_analysis_machine.pickle) for future use in predicting programmer quality based on review texts. Please utilize this pickle file in the boss-files directory for predictions.

Represents an updated approach for predicting programmer quality.
Includes similar directories (private_files and boss-files) with updated code and models based on new criteria.

Model Training Overview:
2. Trained Models:

* Naive Bayesian (MultinomialNB):
Overview: Utilizes Multinomial Naive Bayes classification for prediction.
Preprocessing: Text data undergoes punctuation removal, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Features extracted using CountVectorizer with custom preprocessing.
Accuracy: Achieves an average accuracy of approximately 92% through k-fold cross-validation.

* Random Forest:
Overview: Employs Random Forest classifiers for prediction.
Preprocessing: Similar preprocessing steps applied to text data.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes CountVectorizer for feature extraction.
Accuracy: Demonstrates an average accuracy of around 25% through k-fold cross-validation.

3-Recommendation:
Utilize the Naive Bayesian model for prediction due to its superior accuracy compared to Random Forest.

4-Model Limitations:
Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB): Assumes feature independence, may struggle with correlated words.
Random Forest: Prone to overfitting without proper tuning, computationally intensive.

5-Misclassification Reasons:
Ambiguous language, sarcasm, or nuanced sentiments in reviews.
Data imbalance favoring certain quality classes.

6-Instructions for Prediction:
* Preparation of Review Data:

Organize programmer reviews into a CSV file with two columns:1-IDs ,2-review texts.
Ensure that all review texts are merged and placed in the second column as indicated.

Use the prediction code in boss-files folder to assess programmer quality using trained models.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. I am here to provide additional information or support as needed.

Best Regards,

Elham
